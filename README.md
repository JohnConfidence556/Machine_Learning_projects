Diabetes Prediction

This project is a machine learning-based diabetes prediction model that uses patient health data to predict the likelihood of diabetes. The model is built using Python and popular data science libraries.

📌 Project Overview

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions worldwide. Early detection can help in better management and prevention of complications. This project utilizes machine learning to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on various medical attributes.

📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant

Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration

Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

Skin Thickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

Diabetes Pedigree Function: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history

Age: Age of the patient

Outcome: Whether the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0)


🔧 Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas & NumPy (for data preprocessing)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
